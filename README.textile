h1. ExSponge

An HTML / WYSIWYG / Microsoft Word / Rich Text editor cleanup plugin for "ExpressionEngine":http://www.expressionengine.com v2

h2. Info

This plugin cleans up the mess your clients leave behind!

Whether your content was entered via WYSIWYG (Rich Text) editors (such as TinyMCE, CKEditor, FCKEditor, Expresso, Wyvern, Wygwam, Blogger's online editor, and ExpressionEngine's own built-in Rich Text Editor), pasted in from Microsoft Word or Adobe InDesign, or bulk-imported from XML or another CMS, ExSponge leaves it properly formatted and free of layout-breaking cruft.

It will also optionally remove all tags, or keep only the tags you want. And you can even trim the fully filtered, cruft-free content down to a specified number of paragraphs.

This plugin is for developers who want neatly formatted paragraphs with minimal styling, and who do not want the proprietary tags and unnecessary parameters inserted by word processors (or the "tag soup" unwittingly generated by clients) compromising their layout.

Although undoubtedly less comprehensive than HTML TIDY or HTML Purifier, it is also more efficient, easier to set up, and focused on the specific problems you will likely encounter if you give your clients a WYSIWG field with which to edit their channel entries. In my worst-case scenario (a Microsoft Word document exported to HTML and pasted into an EE Rich Text field), ExSponge reduced the data size by 97% without any loss in content.

Some of what is removed by default:

* Word document garbage (including comments, proprietary styles, irrelevant formatting tags, etc.)
* Empty tag pairs (including empty paragraphs)
* Unnecessary or layout-breaking tags (html, iframe, head, style, center, form, object, etc.)
* Unnecessary parameters within tags (unless otherwise specified)
* Classes and styles within tags (unless otherwise specified)
* Non-printing and control characters
* Newlines (@\n@) and linefeeds (@\r@)
* Extra whitespace
* Anchor links
* Empty lines
* JavaScript
* XML

In addition, poorly escaped HTML entities (@&amp;quot;@ for example) are corrected, all HTML entities are converted to their ASCII equivalents, special Word characters are converted to UTF-8, and non-breaking spaces (@&nbsp;@) are converted to normal spaces. Paragraph formatting is given special attention, and missing paragraph start and end tags are inserted where needed.

The final output will be compact, tidy, and ready to use in your layout.

h2. Installation

Place the "ex_sponge" folder in your system/expressionengine/third_party folder.

h2. Parameters

_All parameters are optional:_

|_. Parameter |_. Description |_. Default |
| *allow_breaks* | Allow @<br>@  tags to remain as-is ("yes"), or convert double-breaks (@<br><br>@) to paragraphs while leaving single breaks alone ("single"), or consolidate all breaks into paragraphs ("no"). | "no" |
| *allow_parameters* | Allow tag parameters to remain ("yes"), strip all but the most necessary ("no", which is the equivalent of "alt&#124;href&#124;src&#124;title", or strip all parameters except the ones you list. | "no" |
| *allow_styles* | Allow class and style parameters to remain ("yes"). | "no" |
| *allow_tags* | Strip all HTML tags from the text ("no"), strip most tags but keep the most useful and safe ("safe", which is the equivalent of "&lt;a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;&lt;img&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;h6&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"), or strip all tags except the ones you list. | "safe" |
| *convert_tags* | Convert presentational tags @<i>@ and @<b>@ to the semantic @<em>@ and @<strong>@ ("yes"), or leave them as-is ("no"). | "yes" |
| *paragraphs* | Clip the text after a specified number of paragraphs. Any positive number ("1", "4", "9999") will cause the text to be trimmed. "-1" will not clip the text at all. | "-1" |

h2. Usage

To use this plugin, simply wrap the text you want processed between these tag pairs:

bc. {exp:ex_sponge}
    ( your mess goes here )
{/exp:ex_sponge}

In my templates, I typically wrap the above tag (with no parameters) around the output of any Rich Text or WYSIWYG field the client is allowed to edit.

A more complex example:

bc. {exp:ex_sponge allow_breaks="yes" convert_tags="no" allow_tags="<p><strong><b><em><i><ul><li>"}
    ( your mess goes here )
{/exp:ex_sponge}
